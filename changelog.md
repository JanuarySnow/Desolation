added simply balanced

added true armor SE and know your true armor

fixed skyvalor skill xp bug with SSL

removed hearthcraft linked storage chests

added default values to true armor and simply balanced to make heavy armor bit tankier  and archery bit less lethal

fixed (I hope) some custom animals with hunterborn and quickloot

Now level 1 player in iron armor can take around 5 hits before dying from melee hits

And bandits in heavy armor take around the same, light armor should be still pretty lethal.

Higher level enemies and higher level player in heavy armor I dont want to get TOO tanky, so this may require further tweaking as testing and feedback comes in
